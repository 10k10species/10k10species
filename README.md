# 10k10species
This website has been created for the "10k Apart" contest. It contains everything in less than 9kb (after gzip) and doesn't use any JavaScript. We are using SVGs for the images. This makes the website very lightweight and enables us to animate the lines too.

How much is 10kb?
- Half a second of mp3 audio (at 192kbps)
